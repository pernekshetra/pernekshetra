Simple website to create a profile image using overlay image and user input image

**Todo: Support cropping/rearranging
Feel free to add features and raise PR**

Why this site was built: 
Shree Perne Muchilot Bhagavathi Kshetra is hosting “Kaliyatam” in 2024. To make this event special, the temple asked its community members to plant a tree at each home. Around 3000 homes planted fruit bearing plant today. The idea behind this noble initiative was to thank the nature, seek her blessings and also to strengthen the idea of community. 
Doing great things together! 

As part of the event, the organizers wanted to create special profile pictures with an overlay. However, the existing method for making these profile pictures was complicated. It was hard to use, showed ads, and some solutions required a login. The most difficult part was that everyone had to download the overlay and upload it to a different website, making the whole process challenging.
The organizers wanted something simpler and easier to use. 

So on a Friday night, I built a basic website https://pernekaliyata.in. It took about 2 hours to learn how to build it and then 3 hours to actually build it. I spent another hour testing it. I started working at 11 PM and finished at 5 AM the next morning. I wanted to add scroll, crop features but could not finsih it on time. 
In the following two days, nearly 2000 users used the website, and they created over 5000 images using it. It was great feeling to see everyone from young ones to elders use the site without much difficulties.
